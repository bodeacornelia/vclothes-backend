# nodemon.json - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

1. ext - nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions .ts
2. ignore - ignore some specific files
3. watch - by default nodemon monitors the current working directory.
